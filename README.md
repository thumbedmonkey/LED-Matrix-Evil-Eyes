# Evil Eyes

Based on [Halloween Eyes](http://nja.me/eyes) and modified to use
two LED matrix link boards and the LED matrix master from
[FriedCircuits](http://friedcircuits.us/) instead of the original
Adafruit Bicolor LED Square Pixel Matrix with I2C Backpack although any
Arduino compatible board with MAX7219 LED Display Driver ICs should work.
